# Number Guesser 
For our first paired project at Turing, we set out to create a interative website where two players can play a number guessing game. We were provided with sill images of what the site should look like and with a list of features the game should have. 

## Motivation 
This project was our first opportunity to demonstrate our foundational Javascript skills as well as our CSS abilities
